    The HyperText <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markup_language">Markuplanguage</a> , or HTML is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. 
    It can be assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages such as JavaScript.
Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render the documents into multimedia web pages. 
HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for the appearance of the document.

<b><h2>CSS</h2></b>

<p>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in a markup language such as HTML.
    [1] CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript.
    [2]CSS is designed to enable the separation of presentation and content, including layout, colors, and fonts.
    [3] This separation can improve content accessibility, provide more flexibility and control in the specification of presentation characteristics, enable multiple web pages to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .
    css file which reduces complexity and repetition in the structural content as well as enabling the .
    css file to be cached to improve the page load speed between the pages that share the file and its formatting.</p>
